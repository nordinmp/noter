#Engelsk #Vietnam
1.  Misjudging the enemy and their intentions.
2.  Seeing South Vietnam as little America and not considering the country's unique circumstances.
3.  Misjudging nationalism as a motivator.
4.  Misjudging friends and foes based on cultural and historical differences.
5.  Technology is not always the best. Sometimes, it's more important to have a heart than to have the best technology.
6.  Failing to communicate about large-scale operations with everyone in the US.
7.  Neglecting to explain why they were doing what they did after a plan goes awry.
8.  Leaders don't know everything and don't have the right to shape another country.
9.  The US military should join a larger military force rather than taking control.
10.  Not everyone can be perfect, and sometimes we live in an untidy world.
11.  Top leaders don't always know how to control war and politics.
