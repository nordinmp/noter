Ethics
- The utilitarian approach (the greatest balance of good and evil)
- The rights approach (the right to choose for oneself; the right to the truth, the right of privacy, the right to not be injured, the right to what is agreed)
- The fairness or justice approach (how fair is an action; favoritism and discrimination are unjust)
- The common-good approach (the pursuit of common values and goals, the good of the community)
- The virtue approach (striving toward certain ideals which provide full development of our humanity; reflecting on what kind of people we have the potential to become)
