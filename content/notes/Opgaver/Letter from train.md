Hello Mother and Father.

I just saw the craziest thing Mother. I just saw a metal snake, speeding through the air. It was noisy I tell you Mother. The air was nuanced, on my side it was quiet, but on rails it was crazy loud, the noise was deafening. Father our engineers have done again I tell you. When I saw the train, it was very impressionistic, I was like “pardon me, this is most outrages.” The noise and speed, this locomotive is moving its outrages, it is too fast, what is the next flying with the birds? This whole thing was very symbolic, God was looking down on us all, he was angry that we are pretending to be God. I saw him, I did, He told me: “Nordin you are the messiah, save this people, make sure they all get to heaven”. So, Mother and Father, I have a new life goal, I will make sure that no human will ever touch a train again.

Sin-cerely  
Nordin
