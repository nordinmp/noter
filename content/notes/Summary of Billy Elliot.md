The first part is about the brother and sister talking about them not having a job, they talk about Billy not having a mother and that he needs one. Tony says everyone wants one and that he should just suck it up
and then they meet someone, Tony gets aggressive and walks of. They are very poor so they want something to eat
Jackie was on his way to work, but then strikers came over to beat him up, because they are not allowed to work on a strike. Whilst being beat up, he sees the only person his dosent want to meet Tony, because they not each  other and they were meant to be striking together
